# Symptom Analysis Using NLP

This repository contains the code and resources for my MSc thesis titled "Utilizing Natural Language Processing for Symptom Analysis: A Novel Approach to Understanding Self-Reported Illnesses."

## Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze health-related discussions from online forums (such as Reddit) and therapy sessions. By extracting and comparing insights related to symptoms, treatments, diseases, and sentiment from these diverse data sources, the project aims to enhance our understanding of patient-reported experiences and improve healthcare strategies.

## Features

- **Symptom and Treatment Extraction:** Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to identify and analyze symptoms and treatments mentioned in unstructured text data.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes the emotional tone of discussions to differentiate between public (online forums) and professional (therapy sessions) environments.
- **Co-Occurrence Networks:** Visualizes relationships between symptoms, treatments, and diseases, highlighting common co-occurrences.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compares the frequency and nature of health discussions across different data sources, providing insights into the differences between self-reported and professionally observed health issues.

## Approach

The approach combines multiple NLP techniques, including entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling, to process and analyze the data. The analysis focuses on identifying key patterns and trends that can provide valuable insights for healthcare providers.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered data from online health communities and therapy session transcripts.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data using advanced preprocessing techniques tailored to the healthcare domain.
3. **Entity Extraction:** Identified key entities such as symptoms, treatments, and diseases using customized Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods.
4. **Sentiment and Trend Analysis:** Applied sentiment analysis and topic modeling to uncover emotional patterns and emerging trends in the data.
5. **Visualization:** Created various visual representations (e.g., word clouds, co-occurrence networks) to illustrate the findings.
